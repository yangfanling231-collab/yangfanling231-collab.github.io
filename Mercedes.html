					<h2>Chassis & Materials</h2>
			    	
			    	 <p style="font-size:20px;">
			      		The W16 uses a carbon fibre monocoque structure (as is standard in F1) with bodywork and aerodynamic surfaces also made from carbon composites. 
		 				A key innovation for 2025 is that Mercedes is integrating sustainable carbon fibre composites — making parts of the car with eco-friendlier resin systems and fibre sources — in an effort to reduce the environmental footprint while maintaining performance and safety standards
