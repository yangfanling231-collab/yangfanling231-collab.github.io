        	<p id='a'>Welcome to the high-octane world of Formula 1, where speed meets precision, and every millisecond counts. But behind the glamour and the roar of the engines lies a meticulously crafted set of regulations ensuring fair play, safety, and competitive balance. Let's dive into the key aspects of these rules, sprinkled with a touch of humor to keep things light.</p>

			<img src='https://static.wixstatic.com/media/181d17_f942feff09824963953deb17c7e324c0~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_1620,h_912,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_avif,quality_auto/sewing%20machine%20(4).png' >

			<p>The chassis is the car's backbone, designed for both strength and aerodynamics. Teams invest heavily in wind tunnel testing to sculpt their cars into the most efficient shapes. However, the FIA keeps a close eye to prevent any "creative" interpretations that might give teams an unfair advantage. </p>
			<p>The maximum size of the car is set by rules - in 2025 an F1 car can be no more than 200cm wide and 95 cm tall. Also the maximum distance between front and back wheels is 360 cm.</p>
			<p>The car and driver must together weigh at least 800 kg (applies in F1 2025 season).</p>
			<p>There are also mandatory "crash tests" and "squeeze tests". Electrical and computer systems are inspected at the start of a season and cannot be changed without prior approval.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class='col1'>
			<center><h3>Engines and Power Units</h3></center>
			
			<p>Gone are the days of ear-splitting V10s. Modern F1 cars use 1.6-liter V6 turbo-hybrid engines, balancing performance with environmental considerations. These power units are marvels of engineering, combining internal combustion with electric motors to deliver over 1000 horsepower. It's like having a turbocharged Prius on steroids.</p>

			<P>
				The 2014 - 2025 engine restrictions are as follows:
				<ul>
					<li>Size: 1.6 litre</li>
					<li>Type of engine: V6 (turbo-hybrid)</li>
					<li>Fuel limit per race: 100-110 kg (130 - 145 L)</li>
					<li>Fuel flow rate: 100kg/h / 10 500 RPM</li>
					<li>Engine RPM limit: 15 000</li>
					<li>Power Output: 750 - 1000hp</li>
				</ul>
			</P>

			<p>Pirelli supplies teams with a range of tyre compounds, from soft to hard, each offering different performance characteristics. Choosing the right tyre at the right time can make or break a race. It's akin to selecting the perfect pair of shoes for a marathon—comfort matters, but so does speed.</p>
			<p>The supplier supplies 6 different dry-weather tyres (C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6), and from those only 3 compounds are provided for each race weekend. The softer C6 compound was introduced in 2025 F1 season.</p>
			<p>Additionally there are 2 wet conditions compounds provided by Porelli - intermediate and wet.</p>
			<p>Competitors are allowed 13 dry, 4 intermediate, 3 wet compounds for a race weekend.</p>

        	<p>After weighing during each qualifying session, teams are required to take their cars to a place in the paddock, sectioned off by the FIA, known as parc ferme - they may not do work on the cars, other than routine maintenance, until they are released from parc fermé for the race the next morning.</p>

        	<p>A typical F1 weekend is structured as follows：</p>
        	<ul>
        		<li>
        			Friday: Two practice sessions for teams to fine-tune setups.
        		</li>
        		<li>
        			Saturday: A final practice session followed by qualifying, which determines the starting grid.        		
        		</li>
        		<li>
        			Sunday: The main event—the race itself.
        		</li>

        	<img src='https://idsb.tmgrup.com.tr/ly/uploads/images/2023/12/21/306552.jpg'>
        	<p>Qualifying is divided into three segments:</p>
        	<ol>
        		<li>
        			Q1: All drivers participate; the slowest five are eliminated.
        		</li>
        		<li>
        			Q2: The remaining 15 drivers compete; another five are eliminated.
        		</li>
        		<li>
        			Q3: The top 10 drivers battle for pole position.
        		</li>
        	</ol>
        	<p>It's a bit like musical chairs, but with million-dollar cars and egos to match.</p>

        	<p>Races begin with a standing start, where drivers line up on the grid based on their qualifying positions. When the lights go out, it's pedal to the metal. False starts are penalized, so no jumping the gun—this isn't a 100-meter dash.</p>

        	<p>Points System has changed a lot of times since 1950 - see here all the changes and how they affected the Championships</p>
        	<p>Consistency is key, even a single point can make a difference in the championship. It's like collecting stamps—every little bit counts.</p>

        	<center><h3>Pit Stops and Refueling</h3></center>

        	
        	<p>Refueling during races was banned in 2010 to enhance safety and reduce costs. Now, pit stops focus solely on tyre changes and minor adjustments. A well-executed pit stop can be as quick as two seconds—blink, and you might miss it.</p>

        	<img src='https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/12/F1-Flags-Summary.jpg/v4-460px-F1-Flags-Summary.jpg'>
        	<p>Marshals use flags to communicate with drivers:</p>
        	<ol>
        		<li>
        			Yellow Flag: Caution, no overtaking.
        		</li>
        		<li>
        			Red Flag: Race stopped due to hazardous conditions.
        		</li>
        		<li>
        			Blue Flag: Move over, a faster car is lapping you.
        		</li>
        		<li>
        			Black Flag: You're disqualified, report to the pits.
        		</li>
        	</ol>
        	<p>Ignoring these signals can lead to penalties, so drivers must keep their eyes peeled—not just for the track ahead but also for the rainbow of flags waving around.</p>

       	<div class='col4'>
        	<p>Penalties may be imposed on drivers for numerous offences, including jumping the start, speeding in the pit lane, causing an avoidable accident, unsportsmanlike conduct, or ignoring flags of any color. There are four types of penalty which a driver may incur for violation of on-track rules:</p>
        	<p>A time penalty is the most common type of penalty, and can last either five or ten seconds. It may be served during the next pit stop. After the driver stops in their pit box, mechanics must wait for 5 or 10 seconds before touching the car.</p>
        	<p>Touching the car while the penalty is still in effect will result in another penalty being added for serving the penalty incorrectly. If the driver did not serve their penalty in the pit lane, the time penalty will be added to their time at the end of the race.</p>
        	<p>A drive-through penalty requires the driver to enter the pit lane, drive through it while obeying its speed limit, and exit without stopping. As a drive-through penalty does not require the driver to stop, it is less costly than a stop-go penalty.</p>
        	<p>A ten-second stop-go penalty requires the driver to enter the pit lane, stop at their pit for ten seconds, and exit again. As the stop is designed to punish the driver for an offence, team mechanics are forbidden to work on the offending car at any time while the driver is serving the pena  lty.</p>
        	
        </div>
        
    </div>
    <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
	<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
	<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
	<br><br>
	
	
	


   	<p class=col5>Stop-go penalty is the harshest penalty short of disqualification and is given for serious offences such as endangering other drivers.</p>
    <p class=col5>The most severe penalty in common use is a black flag, which may be imposed for ignoring penalties or for technical irregularities of any sort; it signifies that the driver has been disqualified from the race and their results for that race will not count toward the championship.</p>
    <p class=col5>A grid penalty may be given for the next race, which may increase depending on the severity of a penalty. Grid penalties have also been given due to exceeding the quota of an engine component.</p>
